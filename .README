Known Issues & Improvements

Security
-Passwords are stored in plaintext (should be hashed in production).
-No encryption for sensitive data in transit.

Accessibility
-No keyboard navigation support.
-Lacks screen reader compatibility.

Functional
-Limited to 11 hardcoded currencies.
-Some edge-case error handling missing.

Legal & Ethical Considerations
-GDPR Compliance: User data must be encrypted; plaintext storage is non-compliant.
-Anti-Money Laundering: Transfer caps and transaction flagging help deter misuse.
-Accessibility: Ignoring accessibility excludes users with disabilities and may lead to legal risks (e.g., Domino’s Pizza case, 2019).
